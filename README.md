## Face Shape Detector

This project is a Python application that detects faces in an image or video stream and analyzes their shapes using a combination of aspect ratio and facial landmarks (when available). It's designed for anyone interested in exploring face analysis or building applications that require basic face shape recognition.

## Importance of Face Shape Prediction:

### Personalization:  Knowing your face shape allows for personalization in various aspects:

* Cosmetics: Makeup application techniques and product recommendations can be tailored to complement your face shape (e.g., highlighting techniques for round faces, contouring for square faces).
* Fashion: Choosing hairstyles, eyeglasses, and clothing styles that flatter your face shape can enhance your appearance.
* Aesthetics: Understanding your face shape can help with aesthetic procedures (if considering them) by guiding decisions about what might be most harmonious with your natural features.
